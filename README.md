A fork of vue-cool-lightbox by Lucas Pulliese. These additions allow tabbing through the lightbox once opened.
To view the very excellent original: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessible-vue-cool-lightbox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessible-vue-cool-lightbox)

To allow a keyboard to open the lightbox, add `@keyup.enter="index = mediaIndex"` alongside the the `@click` listener on media items. [View examples.](https://vue-cool-lightbox.lucaspulliese.com/)
